# QR Codes

QR codes can be scanned by a mobile device and take the user to a URL.

# With or without logos
A QR code has redundancy so parts can be obscured and the code can still be scanned. It is common practice to add a logo to the center of a QR code. This could be a HackSpace logo or the logo of the destination, for example twitter.

# Direct or indirect
A direct URL encoded in a QR code take you directly to the resource. QR codes may also use a shortened link that when followed redirects you to the final destination. Direct URLs do not rely on any external service but may be long resulting in a complex detailed QR code that is more difficult to scan. An indirect URL is shorter resulting in a simpler larger QR code that is easier to scan. The indirect service may include the ability to provide information about users scanning the QR code. However it relies on an intermediate service that is not under our control. Some users using shortened links may be redirected to advertising to fund the service.
